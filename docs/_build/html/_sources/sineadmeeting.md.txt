# Meeting with Sinéad

## Graduate Students

You should schedule a time with Sinéad for a 1-1 meeting with you for 30 minutes (this may be longer for new members of the group, before quals, etc.). Each semester you also have one ‘skip’ if you are crunching on a deadline, or have other commitments where you would like to postpone for a week.

You do not need to prepare a formal presentation, but have any information you need feedback on to hand. Keep in mind this advice for preparing for meetings:

In addition, I advise everyone to keep track of the meetings in a dedicated google doc or similar  (your ‘PIdoc’) that is your responsibility to update, and share it with Sinéad at the start of each meeting. 

Before each meeting, you should:

1. Prepare a brief agenda of the items that you need feedback on during the 30 mins. Keep in mind the time constraints of the meeting, and so you should prioritize the topics that you need feedback on. This should be completed before your meeting and put into your PIdoc. 
2. Prepare figures/graphs/overleaf with equations for any science questions you need my input on. These should be clear and shareable over zoom, or sent to via email before the meeting. Overleafs can be linked to in the PIdoc. 
3. Following the meeting, write a bulleted summary with a list of items for completion in the PIdoc. This will be referred to at the beginning of the next meeting. 

An example PIDoc is here:

## Postdocs 

You should either (1) schedule a regular 1-1 meeting on a biweekly basis for 30 mins, or (2) discuss with Sinéad for on-demand meetings when needed but with a similar frequency. 


## Long Meetings

Longer meetings can be scheduled on demand with Sinéad but typically limited to once a semester -- I’m borrowing Anubhav’s policy for scheduling longer meetings:

> Longer, targeted meetings are welcome so long as you have a clear purpose for them. In particular, if a difficult decision needs to be made or you’d like to brainstorm a technical problem, a longer meeting will almost certainly work better than e-mail. To schedule a targeted meeting, you should first e-mail me and tell me why you’d like to meet (or simply describe your need at a 30-minute meeting). If a meeting is in fact the best solution, we will work out a time and place to have the meeting.
