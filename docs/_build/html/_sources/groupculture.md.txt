# Group Culture

First and foremost, we endeavor to have a safe, encouraging and productive group. We all have a role to play in creating this. Please be helpful and encouraging to your colleagues. When new members are joining, please make them feel welcome and be responsive to their questions. Aside from the ‘official’ welcome lunch, please ensure that new members are included in lunch plans during the first week.

For help or advice with personal issues, the Lab runs the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides free and confidential counseling, consultation, and referral for LBNL staff. 

There are several IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accountability) initiatives and resources both at Division level and at the Lab. Should you have any questions or concerns, please talk with Sinéad or any other staff member.
