# HP Computational Resources

The Griffin group has access to the following computational resources: 

## LRC, hosted by LBNL

For an account on our local cluster, you will need to follow two steps:
* Fill out a user agreement form 
https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/high-performance-computing-services-group/useragreement

* Fill out the following account request form asking for access to the clusters below. You will need a PID to fill out the form -- double check with Sinéad which PID you should use. If you don’t have an employee ID, ask Sinéad what to do.

**CATAMOUNT** -  MSD cluster under PI Jeffrey Neaton
**ETNA** - Foundry Cluster under PI David Prendergast
**NANO** - Foundry Cluster  under PI David Prendergast

Depending on the time of the year, Lawrencium access can take up to a week.
Sample job submission scripts and available codes are on the shared space on LRC. (**add link**)

## NERSC, a national facility hosted by the DOE

Apply for an account:
https://iris.nersc.gov/add-user

* The repo account most you will apply to for FY2022 is m3349, ‘quantumtheory’, under PI Sinéad Griffin. 

* Those working on Dark Matter research should apply to m3451, "Quantum sensors consortium material calculations" under PI Maurice Garcia-Sciveres. 

* Those working on Microelectronics research should apply to m4114, “Codesign of Ultra-Low-Voltage Beyond CMOS Microelectronics" under PI Lavanya Ramakrishnan.

Once you have submitted this form, I (or the PI) will be notified of your request and approve it. NERSC will then email you a link to set up your password and you are ready to use the NERSC resources (typically within one working day).

**Note:** NERSC resources are allocated from an application on an annual basis. As such the hours are limited. Please use NERSC as you wish, but keep an eye on your usage, and let me know if you think you will run out before the end of the year. You will also need to be added separately to the VASP license at NERSC. Ensure that you let Sinéad know that you plan on using VASP at NERSC as this is a parallel process to getting an account.

**Cori** - CPU
**Perlmutter** - GPU
